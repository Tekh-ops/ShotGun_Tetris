Winning is structured like Tetris, where the player tries to get points by
clearing full rows. The catch is the player cannot move the falling blocks,
but may shoot them instead as they fall, to knock them into a needed shape
or remove them entirely. As time goes on more and more blocks fall and the
speed increases.
